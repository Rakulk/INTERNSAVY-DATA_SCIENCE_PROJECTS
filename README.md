# INTERNSAVY-DATA_SCIENCE_PROJECTS
Welcome to my INTERNSAVY Data Science Internship Projects repository! Here, I have showcased the three exciting data science projects I completed during my internship at INTERNSAVY. Each project demonstrates various data analysis and machine learning techniques to tackle real-world challenges. Read on to explore the projects and their key findings.
# PROJECT-1 PREDICTION OF UNIVERSITY ADMISSION USING CLASSIFICATION  
This data science project predicts the likelihood of admission to a university based on various factors using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm. The model achieved high accuracy and identified positive correlations between GRE score, TOEFL score, CGPA, and the likelihood of admission.

üîç Key Findings:

High accuracy in predicting admission outcomes. Strong performance in identifying admitted candidates. Positive correlations between GRE score, TOEFL score, and CGPA with admission likelihood. üí° Insights: The model provides valuable predictions, but it's crucial to consider it as part of a holistic evaluation process, including other factors like application materials and interviews.

üåü Lessons Learned: The project enhanced skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, while overcoming outliers and ensuring data quality.
