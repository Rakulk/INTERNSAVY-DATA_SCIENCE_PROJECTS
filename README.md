# INTERNSAVY-DATA_SCIENCE_PROJECTS
Welcome to my INTERNSAVY Data Science Internship Projects repository! Here, I have showcased the three exciting data science projects I completed during my internship at INTERNSAVY. Each project demonstrates various data analysis and machine learning techniques to tackle real-world challenges. Read on to explore the projects and their key findings.
# PROJECT-1 PREDICTION OF UNIVERSITY ADMISSION USING CLASSIFICATION  
This data science project predicts the likelihood of admission to a university based on various factors using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm. The model achieved high accuracy and identified positive correlations between GRE score, TOEFL score, CGPA, and the likelihood of admission.

üîç Key Findings:

High accuracy in predicting admission outcomes. Strong performance in identifying admitted candidates. Positive correlations between GRE score, TOEFL score, and CGPA with admission likelihood. üí° Insights: The model provides valuable predictions, but it's crucial to consider it as part of a holistic evaluation process, including other factors like application materials and interviews.

üåü Lessons Learned: The project enhanced skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, while overcoming outliers and ensuring data quality.

# Project 2: Unveiling Mall Customer Segmentation - A Clustering Analysis Approach

This data analysis project focuses on customer segmentation using clustering analysis. The dataset contains information about mall customers, including their age, annual income, and spending score.

üîç Key Findings:

Utilized K-means clustering to identify distinct customer segments based on annual income and spending score. Visualized clusters and cluster centroids to understand customer groupings and central tendencies. Performed silhouette analysis to evaluate clustering performance. Presented feature distribution for each cluster. üí° Insights: Customer segmentation provides valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies, personalized experiences, and business optimization.

üåü Lessons Learned: The project demonstrated how clustering techniques help uncover hidden patterns within customer data, enabling data-driven decision-making for business growth.

# Project 3: Customer Segmentation Analysis - Uncovering Insights and Patterns for Business Optimization 

This machine learning project aims to analyze customer data from a mall to uncover insights and patterns for business optimization. The dataset consists of customer information, including age, annual income, and spending score.

üîç Key Findings:

Employed K-means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups based on age, annual income, and spending score. Visualized the clusters in 2D and 3D space using scatter plots and PCA. Explored hierarchical clustering to understand the hierarchical structure of the data. üí° Insights: The customer segments provide valuable information for targeted marketing, customer satisfaction improvement, and business strategy optimization.

üåü Lessons Learned: The project showcased the power of unsupervised learning techniques in customer segmentation, enabling businesses to better understand their customer base and make data-driven decisions.
